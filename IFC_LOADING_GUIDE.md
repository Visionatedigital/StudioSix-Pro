# ðŸŽ¯ Simple 3D File Loading Guide

## âœ… **What Works Instantly**

Your viewer now supports these formats **out of the box**:
- **glTF/GLB files** - Perfect geometry, instant loading
- **OBJ files** - Also works great
- **IFC files** - Need 30-second conversion (see below)

## ðŸš€ **For IFC Files (Easy 2-Step Process)**

### Step 1: Convert IFC to glTF (30 seconds)
1. Go to: **https://products.aspose.app/cad/conversion/ifc-to-gltf**
2. Upload your `.ifc` file
3. Download the `.glb` file

### Step 2: Load the glTF file
1. In your app, select the downloaded `.glb` file
2. **Real geometry loads instantly!** âœ¨

## ðŸŽ¬ **Alternative Online Converters**

If the first one doesn't work, try these:
- **https://anyconv.com/ifc-to-gltf-converter/**
- **https://convertio.co/ifc-gltf/**
- **https://cloudconvert.com/ifc-to-gltf**

## ðŸ’¡ **Why This Works Better**

- âœ… **No complex WASM setup**
- âœ… **No browser compatibility issues** 
- âœ… **Perfect geometry every time**
- âœ… **Works with any IFC file**
- âœ… **Fast and reliable**

## ðŸ”§ **Technical Details**

The viewer uses xeokit's native glTF loader which:
- Handles complex geometry perfectly
- Supports textures and materials
- Includes proper lighting and shadows
- Allows full interaction (zoom, pan, rotate)

## ðŸŽ¯ **Result**

Instead of placeholder walls, you get **real IFC geometry** that looks exactly like your model!
