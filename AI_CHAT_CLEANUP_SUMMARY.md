# 🧹 AI Chat Cleanup Summary

## ✅ **Changes Made: Cleaner Conversational Experience**

The AI chat has been cleaned up to provide a more conversational experience without constant notifications and distractions.

### 🚫 **Removed: Automatic Notifications**

**1. Welcome Message Removed:**

- ✅ Clean, simple empty state with minimal introduction

**2. Object Creation Notifications Removed:**
- ❌ "✅ wall created successfully" after every object creation

- ✅ AI can still execute commands, but won't spam the chat

**3. Speech Recognition Error Messages Removed:**
- ❌ "🎤 Could not start voice recognition. Please try again."
- ✅ Errors logged to console instead of cluttering chat

### ✅ **Added: Clean Empty State**
