## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Start the Email Proxy Server
```bash
cd web-app
RESEND_API_KEY=your_key_here node email-proxy-server.js
```

### 2. Create Resend Audience
In your Resend dashboard:
1. Go to Audiences
2. Create a new audience called "StudioSix Early Access"
3. Note the audience ID (update in email-proxy-server.js line 330 if needed)

### 3. Add Your GIF Animations
Replace the placeholder in `LandingPage.js` around line 180:
```jsx
{/* Replace this placeholder with your actual GIF */}
<div className="aspect-video bg-gradient-to-br from-studiosix-900/50 to-purple-900/50 rounded-2xl flex items-center justify-center mb-6">
  {/* Add your timelapse GIF here */}
  <img src="/path-to-your-kitchen-animation.gif" alt="Kitchen Design Animation" />
</div>
```

### 4. Customize Content
Update content in `LandingPage.js`:
- **Hero suggestions** (line 118) - Change the typewriter prompts
- **Features** (line 237) - Update the feature descriptions
- **Testimonials** (line 282) - Replace with real customer feedback

### 5. Update Calendly Link
In both `ThankYouPage.js` and the email template, update:
```javascript
window.open('https://calendly.com/your-actual-link', '_blank');
```

The landing page integrates seamlessly with your existing authentication and app architecture. All existing functionality remains unchanged - the landing page is purely additive.

For questions about the implementation, check:

2. **API**: Standard REST endpoints with error handling  
3. **Styling**: Uses existing Tailwind classes
4. **State Management**: No complex state, pure functional components
